Description: Processing pipeline for 'SamBada' from pre- to post-processing. 
	'SamBada' is a landscape genomic software designed to run univariate or multivariate logistic regression between the presence of a genotype and one or several environmental variables. 
	The package provides functions that can be classified into four categories: 
	1) Install 'SamBada' 
	2) Preprocessing (prepare genomic file into standards compatible with 'SamBada' and apply quality-control; retrieve environmental conditions at sampling location; prepare environmental file including removal of correlated variables and computation of population structure) 
	3) Processing (run 'SamBada' on multiple cores using 'Supervision')
	4) Post-processing (calculate p-values and q-values, produce interactive Manhattan plots and query 'Ensembl' database, produce maps).
