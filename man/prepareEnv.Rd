\usage{
prepareEnv(envFile, outputFile, maxCorr, idName, separator = " ",
  genoFile = NULL, numPc = 0.5, mafThresh = NULL,
  missingnessThresh = NULL, ldThresh = NULL, numPop = -1,
  clustMethod = "kmeans", includeCol = NULL, excludeCol = NULL,
  popStrCol = NULL, x, y, locationProj, interactiveChecks = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{envFile}{char Name of the input environmental file (must be in active directory). Can be .csv or .shp}

\item{outputFile}{char Name of the output file. Must have a .csv extension.}

\item{maxCorr}{double A number between 0 and 1 specifying the maximum allowable correlation coefficient between environmental files. If above, one of the variables will be deleted}

\item{idName}{char Name of the id in the environmental file matching the one of \code{genoFile}}

\item{separator}{char If \code{envFile} is .csv, the separator character. If file created with create_env, separator is ' '}

\item{genoFile}{char (optional) Name of the input genomic file (must be in active directory). If not null, population variable will be calculated from a PCA relying on the SNPRelate package. Can be .gds, .ped, .bed, .vcf. If different from .gds, a gds file (SNPrelate specific format) will be created}

\item{numPc}{double If above 1, number of principal components to analyze. If between 0 and 1, automatic detection of number of PC (the program will find the first leap in the proportion of variance where the ratio (difference in variance between PC x and x+1)/(variance of PC x) is greater than \code{numPc}. If 0, PCA and population structure will not be computed: in that case, the \code{genoFile} will only be used to make the sample order in the \code{envFile} match the one of the \code{genoFile} (necessary for sambada's computation). Set it to 0 if \code{genoFile} is null}

\item{mafThresh}{double A number between 0 and 1 specifying the Major Allele Frequency (MAF) filtering when computing PCA (if null no filtering on MAF will be computed)}

\item{missingnessThresh}{double A number between 0 and 1 specifying the missing rate filtering when computing PCS(if null no filtering on missing rate will be computed)}

\item{ldThresh}{double A number between 0 and 1 specifying the linkage disequilibrium (LD) rate filtering before computing the PCA (if null no filtering on LD will be computed)}

\item{numPop}{integer If not null, clustering based on \code{numPc} first PC will be computed to divide into \code{numPop} populations. If -1 automatic detection of number of cluster (elbow method if \code{clustMethod} = 'kmeans', maximise branch length if \code{clustMethod} = 'hclust'). If null, no clustering will be computed: if \code{genoFile} is set, principal component scores will be included as population information in the final file.}

\item{clustMethod}{char One of 'kmeans' or 'hclust' for K-means and hierarchical clustering respectively. Default 'kmeans'}

\item{includeCol}{character vector Columns in the environmental file to be considered as variables. If none specified, all numeric variables will be considered as env var except for the id}

\item{excludeCol}{character vector Columns in the environmental file to exclude in the output (non-variable column). If none specified, all numeric variables will be considered as environmental variables except for the id}

\item{popStrCol}{character vector Columns in the environmental file describing population structure (ran elsewhere). Those columns won't be excluded when correlated with environmental files}

\item{x}{character Name of the column corresponding to the x coordinate (or longitude if spherical coordinate). If not null, x column won't be removed even if correlated with other variable. This parameter is also used to display the map of the population structure.}

\item{y}{character Name of the column corresponding to the y coordinate (or latitude if spherical coordinate). If not null, y column won't be removed even if correlated with other variable. This parameter is also used to display the map of the population structure.}

\item{locationProj}{integer EPSG code of the projection of x-y coordinate}

\item{interactiveChecks}{logical If TRUE, plots will show up showing number of populations chosen, and correlation between variables and the user can interactively change the chosen threshold for \code{maxCorr} and \code{numPop} (optional, default value=FALSE)}

\item{verbose}{boolean If true show information about progress of the process}

None

\description{
Writes a new environmental file that sambada can work with after having removed too correlated variables. Also calculates population structure from a PCA in SNPRelate and add it at the end of the environmental file
}
\details{
The population structure is calculated as a PCA of all the SNPs that pass the filtering (maf, ld, missingness). You can either choose to use the score of the X first components to evaluate the population structure (set `numPop` to NULL) or you can compute a "membership coefficient" to a cluster of individuals based on the scores on the first X components. You can choose between two clustering algorithm (k-means or hierarchical cluster in the `clustMethod` argument). One of the option to decide the number of PCs that you should keep is to detect a bump in the proportion of variance explained and keep all the PC before the bump.
